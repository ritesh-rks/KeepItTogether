# What I learnt from this project


This project has been an enlightening experience for me as I delved deep into the intricacies of the Document Object Model (DOM) and its role in web development. Alongside this, I also acquired a profound understanding of local storage and its practical implementation in JavaScript. My expertise in event listeners also significantly improved as I worked on them extensively during the project. Moreover, I learned how to create a captivating hamburger menu using JavaScript, which was an exhilarating experience. Lastly, I was able to augment my proficiency in JavaScript through the acquisition of various methods such as location.reload(), remove(), target, and dataset, which proved to be quite useful in implementing various functionalities.
